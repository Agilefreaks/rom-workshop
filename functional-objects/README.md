# Functional objects

## Exercises

### Modelling with functonal objects

Imagine we are building a feature for a blog whereby articles are imported from another feed:

- [ ] Consider how this might be broken apart into multiple functional objects
- [ ] Write code for the top-most `ImportArticles` class that uses these other objects to do its work

### In practice

- [ ] Think of how something you've written before could be modelled as functional objects
- [ ] Think of something you've written that would have been better broken up into smaller units of responsibility

## Further exploration...

- [ ] For the functional objects you arranged above, write unit tests for the top-most object
